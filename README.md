# Dominion of Light

This is the start of a great journey. The creation of Dominion of Light the game. The first iteration of the game will be done using Visual Novel Maker by DEGICA Co. Ltd.

## Mission

Although this project may never get truly released but there are many other goals I wish to achieve with this project.

1. **Unlimited game play** - This is at the core of the games design
2. Unlimited character building
   1. Skill progression based on how you play not a point system
3. Massive open world
   1. Improbable to explore entirely
   2. Persistance
   3. Never exactly the same when revisiting
   4. Evolving
4. New quests all the time that evolve with the world
   1. Minor quest opportunities everywhere
   2. Full campaigns form automatically
   3. No static story lines
5. Tell the Dominion of Light story
   1. This world has been designed, refactored, and grown for over 10 years.
   2. It is my favorite creation
